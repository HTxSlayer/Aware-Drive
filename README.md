AwareDrive: Camera-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection System
AwareDrive is a smart application designed to improve road safety by detecting driver drowsiness using camera technology. This project leverages real-time video feed analysis to monitor the driver's facial expressions, eye movements, and head position, identifying signs of fatigue or inattention. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers visual and auditory alerts to prompt the driver to take corrective action, helping to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

Features:
Camera-Based Detection: Uses computer vision to analyze the driver's face for drowsiness indicators such as drooping eyelids and head tilt.
Real-Time Monitoring: Processes video data in real-time to ensure immediate response to signs of fatigue.
Alert System: Triggers visual and audio alerts to warn the driver of potential drowsiness.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive interface for easy interaction and customization of alert settings.
Objectives:
Develop a robust algorithm to detect driver drowsiness based solely on camera data.
Ensure real-time, accurate performance under varying lighting conditions and driving environments.
Build an alert system that effectively notifies the driver when drowsiness is detected.
Validate the systemâ€™s effectiveness through extensive testing and continuous improvement.
Technology Stack:
YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and facial analysis.
Python for algorithm development and processing.
OpenCV for image processing.
Streamlit for creating a user-friendly application interface.
This project aims to provide a scalable and adaptable solution that can be integrated into various vehicle systems, enhancing road safety by proactively addressing drowsy driving.
